EVON

This is like JSON.stringify and parse except that it can restore pretty much any JS object accurately, whereas JSON distorts a lot of details.

The performance varies between browsers, but seems to be about 4 times slower than JSON. Both are blisteringly fast anyway so that doesn't really matter.

Please refer to test/cases.js for examples of what it can do.

You can run http://adrianmay.github.io/evon/test/test.html to see performance figures.
