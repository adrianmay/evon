<h1>EVON</h1>

<p>This is like JSON.stringify and parse except that it can restore pretty much any JS object accurately, whereas JSON distorts a lot of details.

<p>The performance varies between browsers, but seems to be about 4 times slower than JSON. Both are blisteringly fast anyway so that doesn't really matter.

<p>Please refer to test/cases.js for examples of what it can do.

<p>You can run <a href='http://adrianmay.github.io/evon/test/test.html'>these performance tests</a> to compare the performance with JSON.
